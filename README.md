## Prerequisites

The script requires the following dependencies:

1. **Postfix** (or another Mail Transfer Agent)
2. **mailutils** (provides the `mail` command used for SMS)
3. **iconv** (for proper character encoding in SMS messages)

## Installation

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Install Dependencies</strong></summary>

```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install postfix, mailutils and other dependencies
sudo apt install postfix mailutils libc-bin
```
> **Note:** `iconv` is included in `libc-bin`, so installing `libc-bin` will provide `iconv`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Configure Postfix</strong></summary>

During installation:

* Select **"Internet Site"** when prompted
* For the system mail name, you'll be prompted to enter a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). If this is just for local use on your home network, entering `localhost.localdomain` or `raspberrypi.local` is sufficient.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Install the Script</strong></summary>

```bash
# Copy the script to /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp reconnect_router.sh /usr/local/bin/

# Make it executable
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/reconnect_router.sh
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Create a Systemd Service</strong></summary>

Create a new service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/reconnect_router.service
```

Add the following content:

```ini

</details>

### Advanced Configuration

<details>
<summary><strong>Startup Notification Management</strong></summary>

The script includes a feature to prevent duplicate startup notifications when the service restarts frequently:

```bash
# Startup notification configuration
STARTUP_CHECK_FILE="/tmp/reconnect_router_last_start"
STARTUP_THRESHOLD=300  # 5 minutes
```

If the script restarts within 5 minutes of a previous run, it will suppress the startup SMS notification to reduce message spam. You can adjust the threshold by changing the value (in seconds).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Heartbeat Monitoring</strong></summary>

The script includes a heartbeat system that:
- Silently monitors script execution in the background
- Detects script interruptions or system failures
- Calculates downtime during script interruptions
- Sends alerts ONLY when the script resumes after unexpected downtime

To configure heartbeat monitoring:

```bash
# Heartbeat Configuration
HEARTBEAT_ENABLED=true         # Set to false to disable heartbeat
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=3600        # Time between heartbeats in seconds (1 hour)
MISSED_HEARTBEATS_THRESHOLD=3  # Alert after this many missed heartbeats
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Enhanced Lock File Handling</strong></summary>

The script now includes improved lock file management:
- Detects and removes stale lock files from crashed script instances
- Stores PID in the lock file for better tracking
- Properly releases locks during script termination
- Verifies /tmp directory permissions

This prevents issues where a crashed script might leave behind a lock file that blocks future script runs.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>SMS Notifications</strong></summary>

The script implements a sophisticated message queuing system:
- Messages are queued when internet connectivity is unavailable
- When connection is restored, the script intelligently processes the queue
- START, ALERT, and CRITICAL messages are prioritized
- TRYING and HEARTBEAT messages may be skipped to reduce spam
- Recovery messages (OK) include downtime duration and attempt count

Example recovery message:
```
[OK] Pi-hole Online! Down: 2m30s. 3/10 attempts
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Internet Connectivity Handling</strong></summary>

The script distinguishes between two types of connectivity issues:
1. **Complete connection loss** â€” Cannot reach the router
2. **Internet-only failures** â€” Can reach the router but not the internet

For internet-only failures, the script uses a more gradual approach:
```bash
# Internet failure tracking settings
INTERNET_FAILURES=0
MAX_INTERNET_FAILURES=5
```

When internet-only failures persist for multiple cycles, the script will attempt a network restart after reaching the threshold, but with less aggressive timing than for complete connection loss. The script also enforces a minimum interval between interface restarts via:

```bash
RESTART_TIME_FILE="/tmp/reconnect_last_iface_restart"
RESTART_INTERVAL=180  # 3 minutes minimum between restarts
```

Additionally, to avoid noise from short-term internet drops, recovery SMS messages are only sent after a configurable threshold:

```bash
# Alert threshold for internet-only recoveries
SMS_INTERNET_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=10
```
This ensures that recovery alerts (e.g., [OK]) are only sent after prolonged internet failures.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>DNS Connectivity Checking</strong></summary>

The script uses multiple DNS servers to verify internet connectivity:

```bash
DNS_CHECK_HOSTS=("1.1.1.1" "1.0.0.1")  # Cloudflare IPv4 redundancy
SMS_INTERNET_CHECK="8.8.8.8"  # For SMS delivery checks
```

This redundancy helps prevent false positives when a single DNS server might be temporarily unavailable.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Adaptive Retry with Exponential Backoff</strong></summary>

During extended network outages, the script uses exponential backoff to avoid excessive reconnection attempts:

```bash
# Calculate backoff delay (2^n)
backoff=$((RETRY_DELAY * (2 ** (consecutive_failures - 5))))

# Cap the backoff at 10 minutes (600 seconds)
if [ "$backoff" -gt 600 ]; then
    backoff=600
fi
```

This means:
- First 5 failures: Normal retry interval
- 6th failure: 2x normal delay
- 7th failure: 4x normal delay
- 8th failure: 8x normal delay
- 9th failure: 16x normal delay
- 10th+ failure: 40x normal delay (capped at 10 minutes)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Advanced Mail Configuration (Optional)</strong></summary>

**Note:** For Gmail, you must use an [app password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords), not your regular password.

If you want to use a relay service like Gmail to send your notifications:

1. Edit the Postfix configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
   ```

2. Add the following lines:
   ```
   relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
   smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
   smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
   smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
   smtp_use_tls = yes
   ```

3. Create a password file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
   ```

4. Add your credentials:
   ```
   [smtp.gmail.com]:587 your-email@gmail.com:your-password
   ```

5. Hash and secure the password file:
   ```bash
   sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
   sudo chmod 600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
   sudo systemctl restart postfix
   ```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Enhanced Error Handling</strong></summary>

The script includes sophisticated error handling:

- **Diagnostic logging** â€” Tracks script termination reasons via journal analysis
- **Fallback log paths** â€” Automatically redirects logs to /tmp if standard paths are unavailable
- **Cross-platform compatibility** â€” Better detection of system-specific networking tools (dhclient vs dhcpcd)
- **Log path verification** â€” Creates log directories if they don't exist with appropriate permissions
- **Log rotation** â€” Automatically rotates log files when they reach 10MB in size

This makes the script more resilient in diverse environments and helps with troubleshooting.
</details>

## Usage

The script will run automatically at system startup. You can manually control it with:

```bash
# Start the service
sudo systemctl enable reconnect_router.service
sudo systemctl start reconnect_router.service

# Check status
sudo systemctl status reconnect_router.service
```

## Monitoring and Logs

<details>
<summary><strong>Viewing Logs</strong></summary>

Check the various logs to see the script's activity:

```bash
# View the main log
tail -f /var/log/reconnect_router.log

# View downtime events
tail -f /var/log/router_downtime.log

# View heartbeat activity
tail -f /var/log/router_heartbeat.log
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Recommended System-Level Log Rotation</strong></summary>

For the most effective log management, set up system-level log rotation:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/reconnect_router
```

Add the following configuration:

```
/var/log/reconnect_router.log /var/log/router_downtime.log /var/log/router_heartbeat.log {
    rotate 4
    weekly
    compress
    size 2M
    missingok
    notifempty
    create 0644 root root
    delaycompress
}
```

This configuration will:
- Rotate logs when they reach 2MB in size
- Perform rotation weekly or when size threshold is reached, whichever comes first
- Keep 4 rotations of history (approximately one month of logs)
- Compress old log files to save space

To apply the configuration immediately:
```bash
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/reconnect_router
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>SMS Alert Types</strong></summary>

The script sends different types of alerts:

- **[START]** - Script has started (suppressed if restarted within 5 minutes)
- **[ALERT]** - Network connection lost
- **[TRYING]** - Reconnection attempts (limited to every 3rd attempt to reduce spam)
- **[OK]** - Connection successfully restored (with concise downtime info and attempt count)
- **[CRITICAL]** - All reconnection attempts failed
</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Script not starting</strong></summary>

- Check if the service is running: `sudo systemctl status reconnect_router.service`
- Verify script permissions: `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/reconnect_router.sh`
- Check for error messages: `sudo journalctl -u reconnect_router.service`
- Look for information in the self-test output in the main log
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Multiple start notifications</strong></summary>

If you're receiving unexpected `[START]` notifications:
* Confirm that your service is correctly using `Restart=always` â€” this is expected for continuous monitoring.
* Check if `STARTUP_THRESHOLD` (default: 300 seconds) is set appropriately for your environment's restart frequency.
* Review logs (`journalctl -u reconnect_router.service`) for crash loops or permission issues causing frequent service restarts.
* If the script is restarting extremely often (multiple times per minute), this indicates a deeper problem and you should check for errors in the script's execution.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>SMS notifications not working</strong></summary>

- Verify the mail command is installed: `which mail`
- Check if iconv is available: `which iconv`
- Test mail configuration manually: 
  ```bash
  echo "Test message" | mail -s "Pi-hole Test" 1234567890@vtext.com
  ```
  Replace the gateway domain with your carrier's SMS gateway as needed.
- Check mail logs: `tail -f /var/log/mail.log`
- Verify carrier gateway settings for your provider
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Network not reconnecting properly</strong></summary>

- Confirm the correct network interface name with: `ip a`
- Verify the router IP is correct: `ping 192.168.1.1` (replace with your router's IP)
- Check the DHCP client is working: `ps aux | grep dhclient` or `ps aux | grep dhcpcd`
- Review verbose dhclient output in the logs
- Verify both dhclient and dhcpcd availability on your system
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Lock file issues</strong></summary>

- Check /tmp directory permissions: `ls -ld /tmp`
- Verify lock file exists: `ls -l /tmp/reconnect_router.lock`
- If you suspect a stale lock file, check if the PID it contains is still running: `cat /tmp/reconnect_router.lock && ps -p $(cat /tmp/reconnect_router.lock)`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Understanding script termination reasons</strong></summary>

The script logs its termination reasons:

```bash
# View the last termination reason
cat /tmp/reconnect_router_last_term.log

# Check clean exit markers
cat /tmp/reconnect_router_clean_exit

# View systemd termination information
sudo journalctl -u reconnect_router.service | grep -i "terminated"
```

These logs can help diagnose why the script might be restarting unexpectedly.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Diagnosing internet-only failures</strong></summary>

If you're experiencing situations where the router is reachable but the internet connection fails:

1. Check the main log for "Can reach router but cannot reach internet" messages
2. Verify the DNS check hosts are reachable from your network: `ping 1.1.1.1` and `ping 1.0.0.1`
3. Consider adjusting the `MAX_INTERNET_FAILURES` value (default: 5) if you have an inconsistent internet connection
4. Review the `RETRY_DELAY` value which affects how quickly the script responds to transient issues
</details>

## Uninstallation

<details>
<summary><strong>Uninstallation Script</strong></summary>

If you need to completely remove the script and its components from your system, you can use the following uninstallation script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Stopping and disabling router-reconnect service..."
sudo systemctl stop reconnect_router.service
sudo systemctl disable reconnect_router.service
echo "Removing service file..."
sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/reconnect_router.service
echo "Removing script..."
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/reconnect_router.sh
echo "Removing logs..."
sudo rm -f /var/log/reconnect_router.log /var/log/router_downtime.log /var/log/router_heartbeat.log
echo "Removing temporary files..."
sudo rm -f /tmp/reconnect_router.lock /tmp/sms_queue.txt /tmp/pihole_last_heartbeat /tmp/reconnect_router_last_start /tmp/reconnect_router_last_term.log /tmp/reconnect_router_clean_exit
echo "Reloading systemd..."
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
echo "Uninstallation complete."
```

Save this as `uninstall_reconnect_router.sh`, make it executable with `chmod +x uninstall_reconnect_router.sh`, and run it with `sudo ./uninstall_reconnect_router.sh`.
